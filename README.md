## What I use for this project
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) because it sounds better than NPM (it apparently is also faster)
- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) because I want to exercise making websites with it

Doing the Nextjs tutorial caused me to include a lot of other libraries:
- [Gray Matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) to parse markdown metadata
- [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to render markdown content
- [Date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) to format dates
