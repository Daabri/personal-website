## context
Festo is a worldwide industrial control and automation company. The Hospitality Assistant project was requested by Festo’s Delft location, who aims to be a bigger presence in their municipality in terms of hospitality. They often host gatherings, events, parties and meetings, and can receive a lot of guests in different rooms with different activities. 

They have showrooms, presentation rooms, and even an escape room to treat their guests accordingly. Frequent visitors are customers, schools, Festo colleagues from abroad, or other companies nearby.

## mission
Festo’s hospitality is important to them, so they have multiple receptionists and a hospitality manager to make sure every visit is a success. They use regular planning software to manage room reservations and catering, which is not tailored to Festo’s specific use case, which results in a lot of error prone reservation adjustments by employees, a lot of work for receptionists, and just general frustration for everyone.

The lack of communication between software and having too many tools for the job creates a repetitive, slow and problematic reservation process for all employees at Festo. The mission is to create a single software solution that can create and manage reservations for visitors. These reservations include data about rooms, gifts, catering and visitor badges, among other things.
