## Responsibilities
- An effective requirements analysis with a conclusive solution proposition
- UI design (wireframes, deliverables)
- UX design
- User research (interviews, observations)
- Occasional frontend development (React, CSS)

## Tools
Adobe XD and Figma (we were transitioning during this project)
## Context
Festo is a worldwide industrial control and automation company. The Hospitality Assistant project was requested by Festo’s Delft location, who aims to be a bigger presence in their municipality in terms of hospitality. They often host gatherings, events, parties and meetings, and can receive a lot of guests in different rooms with different activities. 

They have showrooms, presentation rooms, and even an escape room to treat their guests accordingly. Frequent visitors are customers, schools, Festo colleagues from abroad, or other companies nearby.

## Mission
Festo’s hospitality is important to them, so they have multiple receptionists and a hospitality manager to make sure every visit is a success. They use regular planning software to manage room reservations and catering, which is not tailored to Festo’s specific use case, which results in a lot of error prone reservation adjustments by employees, a lot of work for receptionists, and just general frustration for everyone.

The lack of communication between software and having too many tools for the job creates a repetitive, slow and problematic reservation process for all employees at Festo. The mission is to create a single software solution that can create and manage reservations for visitors. These reservations include data about rooms, gifts, catering and visitor badges, among other things.

## Project goals
- Improve the reservation creation process to make it faster, more reliable and less time-consuming for the people that create and update them.
- Improve the maintainability of a reservation for the hospitality assistant and the receptionists.
- Provide a user experience that anyone can understand within minutes of first using it.
- Allow reservations to include additional information about the type of reservation, rooms, catering, name badges, the host, or promotional gifts.
- Make sure that catering and the hospitality team always have the latest information about upcoming reservations, and the ability to handle them accordingly.

## Design process
### Requirements analysis
A developer and I analysed the customer’s requirements and discussed potential solutions. The customer offered a couple of initial solutions, which I converted into problem statements before starting the ideation process. Sketches of dashboards turned into quotes and “how might we” statements.

### Interviews and observations
Then, I followed up our session by interviewing and observing several people that would be using our solution, which are mostly people from the hospitality team (they use their current reservation process on a daily basis). The goal of this phase is to find out everything about the current process and any additional business requirements.

- The hospitality manager, who manages all bigger reservations like events, parties and tours
- A receptionist. Receptionists make sure that reservations go as planned (lunch is delivered, name tags are made in advance, etc.)
- A sales engineer. Sales engineers most often create smaller reservations, so this allows me to view the process from the ‘creation’ side of things.

This part of the process was very insightful, and helped me understand the problem a lot better.

### Workshops and ideation
With these findings, I had all the business requirements and process information that was necessary to start ideating. I held a discovery workshop with a couple of developers, our head of sales, and the customer. Since it was a digital meeting, I used Adobe XD to present some wireframes and sketched out additional ideas that we discussed.

### Handoff and development
After the workshop, I finalized the propositions into a presentable solution. The challenge here is to create a good handoff method that engineers can use to minimize guessing how a functionality should work. Since the solution was a simple two-screen app and all the details were communicated beforehand, detailed user flows of the app were not deemed necessary. Additionally, because I worked closely with the engineers, any questions they had during development could be answered quickly by me, or I would be implementing my designs myself.

I created two high fidelity mockups and a prototype, then joined the developers in developing the layout and styling using React and CSS.
